Look for line 99-103 in Detector.cc. They should look similar to these:
params.freq_step = 60                                                      
params.ang_step = 2664;                                                   
params.freq_width = 16.667;                                                 
params.freq_init = 83.333;                                                  

-“params.freq_step” accounts for the number of different frequencies that your file has. 
-“params.ang_step” tells the number of different angles that the file has for a single frequency. In this case (180/5+1)*(360/5)=2664 (note that the angle step is 5). This is very standard.
-params.freq_width is the frequency step in MHz.
-params.freq_init accounts for the initial frequency in MHz.

The original AraSim file has 60 frequencies, starting at 83.333 MHz, with a step of 16.667 MHz. You have to modify the values of the previous parameters depending on your input file.

Besides modifying this parameters, one has to change the name of the input file(s) that is(are) going to be used. The original AraSim input files are named ARA_bicone6in_output.txt and ARA_dipoletest_output1.txt for Vpol and Hpol, respectively.
